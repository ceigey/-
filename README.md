## Introduction
### Objective
To create a decent, lightweight and relatively exentsible Language Learning Web App. In addition, to practice reactive web app design.

### Background
There have been many learning apps and programs available to people seeking to learn a language. Many have fallen by the wayside, such as Byki and Livemocha. At the moment, Duolingo is something of a de facto market leader, but Duolingo does not have an accessible backend, with the only way for new courses to be built via the incubator process. This has its own advantages.

However, for supporters of minority languages and conlangers, there is demand for something people can hack around with and deploy quite liberally. This hopefully can lead to something like that.

### Alternatives
*There are alternatives out there, I'm just not sure how many and how far ahead they are*...

## Architecture
Intended to be a front-end heavy app.

## Technologies
### Overview
### UI
* JavaScript -> Elm for reactive functional UI?
### Pseudowiki
* Maybe some sort of Markdown system for writing detailed lessons
### Interactive Lesson Definitions
* Possibly JSON?
